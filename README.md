# NSS: Single Page Applications - Array Function Exercises

### Goals
Implement many a breadth of array & strings methods to accomplish tasks

### Array Methods
Given the following array...
```
var integers = [13, 25, 6, 3, 11, 2, 18, 7, 21, 1, 29, 20, 12, 8];
```
... these tasks were completed:
* Sort the numbers in descending order (10, 9, 8, 7, etc).
* Remove any integers greater than 19.
* Multiply each remaining number by 1.5 and then subtract 1.
* Output (either in the DOM or the console) the sum of all the resulting numbers.

### String Manipulation

With a text input only accepting letters (regex via pattern attribute), the following can be determined of the string:
* The reversal of the string
* The resorting of all the strings letters in alphabetical order
* If it is a palindrome

### Solar System
Given the following array of planets (sorry pluto)...
```
var planets = ["mercury", "venus", "earth", "mars", "jupiter", "saturn", "uranus", "neptune"];
```
* A new array will be created (`.map` method) where the first letter of each planet is capitalized
* Another array will be created (`.filter` method) where only planets with the letter 'e' will be pushed

Given the following array...
```
var words = ["The", "early", "bird", "might", "get", "the", "worm", "but", "the", "second", "mouse", "gets", "the", "cheese"];
```
...& using the `reduce` method, the array will be concatenated into a string.
